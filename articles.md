# Digitalization of administration

Digitalization is everywhere and growing.  Timesaving. Machines, office administration, websites, social media platforms - they are already or fast moving to digital features.

The objectives are efficiency, better quality and less errors. Investments in digital automation are highly profitable.

But when systems take over situational awareness and makes decisions in stead of human beings, power moves as well. Humans become dependent.

Algorithms and use of data becomes still more advanced and opaque.
Too quick or slippy development of IT systems creates weaknesses.
And we know, weak systems will be exployted.

**Misuse of entrusted power for personal gain** - does this exist in digitalized systems? 

Yes - it certainly does already!
