# Digitalization of administration

The market pressure for digitalization is everywhere. Timesaving, efficiency and hope of better quality and less errors makes investments in digital automation profitable.

But when systems take over situation awareness and makes decisions in stead of human beings, power moves as well, and we become dependent.

Algorithms and use of data becomes still more advanced and opaque.
Too quick or slippy development of IT systems creates weaknesses.
And we know, weak systems will be exployted.

Misuse of entrusted power for personal gain - does this exist in digitalized systems? 

Yes - it certainly does already!
