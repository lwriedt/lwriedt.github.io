# The Human Factor

Machines exist in relation with humans in at least three domains.

## Us, the people

[ users of internet content and services like search and encyclopedias ]

[ re-use of good enough content via copy/paste]

[ lazy attitude, best result for least amount of work ]

[ time and delivery pressures on the job, professional or volountering, or commenting/publishing to the general public or in special interest groups ]

[ get better results than the person is capable of - look good, cheating at CV's exams etc ]


## Professionals, developing the AI systems

[ pressure to deliver ever more in an ever diminishing time ]

[ competitive pressures ]

[ easy development and deployment processes without oversight ]

[ shortcuts on testing and verification, immature versions put into production, 'first to market fix later' mentality ]

[ devops and devdataops processes with small autonomous teams ]

## Criminals

Corruption is abuse of entrusted power for private gain.

[ IT people with entrusted power: algorithm developers, data engineers, quality assurance, deployment ]

[ business people with entrusted power: line managers, managers defining the objectives for an AI development, quality asurance ]

[ the people who are using AI systems as part of their daily jobs, allowing the systems to make decions without critical push back ] 

[ bribing IT people ]

AI systems can be used with criminal intent.

[ spotting loopholes in systems prefenting money laundering ]

[ managing complex financial structures to hide and launder illigal funds ]
