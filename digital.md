# Digitalization of administration

The market pressure for digitalization is everywhere.

Algorithms and use of data becomes still more advanced and opaque.
Too quick or slippy development of IT systems creates weaknesses.
And we know, weak systems will be exployted.

Misuse of entrusted power for personal gain - does this exist in digitalized systems? Yes - it certainly does.

An example: Physicians with access have manipulated scanning images, so they will be interpreted by AI systems as indicating cancer.
Healthy paitions are thus sent through a lengthy and expensive investigation, for the profit of the dame physicians.

Transparency International works for openess and agains misuese of entrusted power, also in the digital world.
Unintended effects like bias or even regular corruptoin are both hard to detect, and prevenetion builds on much the same openess, transparency, distribution of power and clear and enforced rules. 
And not the least, to watch out for and work with the weaknesses in the digital systems.
